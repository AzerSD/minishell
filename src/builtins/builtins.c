/**
 * A builtin utility (a.k.a. builtin or internal command) is a command whose
 * code is compiled as part of the shell executable itself, i.e. the shell
 * doesnâ€™t need to execute an external program, nor does it need to fork a
 * new process in order to execute the command. Many of the commands we use
 * on daily basis, such as cd, echo, export, and readonly are in fact builtin
 * utilities. You can read more about shell builtin utilities in this POSIX
 * standard.
 *https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html
 When the name of a built-in command is used as the first word of a simple command,
 the shell executes the command directly, without invoking another program.
 You will need to code echo (with the n option) done
 , cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit
 as built-in commands in your shell.
 This will likely involve writing a function to code its expected behavior.
