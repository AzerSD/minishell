/**
 * A builtin utility (a.k.a. builtin or internal command) is a command whose

 * new process in order to execute the command. Many of the commands we use 
 * on daily basis, such as cd, echo, export, and readonly are in fact builtin 
 * utilities. You can read more about shell builtin utilities in this POSIX
